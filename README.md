# Knewton Styles - Importable style files for Java IDEs

## Summary

At Knewton, we have strict standards on code formatting for internal
projects, which we'd like to extend to our open source projects as
well. To aide in that, this repository provides importable settings
for IntelliJ and Eclipse, and will provide additional settings as
required.

## Installation

See the README in the directory corresponding to your language/IDE
